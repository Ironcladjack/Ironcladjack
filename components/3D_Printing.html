    <h2>3D Printing!</h2>
      <p>I recently bought an Anet A8 and I've been trying to design losts of different prototypes, some to solve minor problems around the house, some as a technical test of my CAD skills and of the 3D printers limiations.</p>
    <h2>The Printer</h3>
      <p>I print using an Anet A8 I bought for around Â£125 from banggood.com, It is about as basic a printer as you can get without desigining it yourself,
         however i've been able to get print quality matching that of other FDM 3D Printers several times more expensive by making / printing a few improvements to the printer.
      </p>

        <img class="centre-image" src="./static/anet_placeholder.jpg" alt="Anet A8 Overview"/>
      </div>
      <p> This is the first 3D printer i've owned, although i did get the opportunity to use some in the Engineering Department of my University as part of my Engineering Degree,
        so I did have more experience than most.<br>
        <br>
        The A8 is shipped as a 'kit' so it required assembly, which was not particularly difficult as the included instructions were clear and the layout of the printer is quite straightforward,
        the build took 4-5 hours.

              <br/>I plan for the container to hold at minimum; some aspirin, a needle and thread, and some matches.</p></td>

            I won a Pint glass in a competition at work recently, however we are advised against using open topped containers so I designed this adapter to convert it into a travel mug.
            <br/> It's printed in two parts, one of which slides up the outside, and the other clamps over the top once threaded together.
            <br/> A thin layer of sheet rubber cut to the right size provides a watertight seal between the rim of the glass and the printed part.

            In pursuit of ever increasing the amount of things i can control from my Home server, I've been working on controlling a stepper motor using arduino to move my windows blinds up and down.
            <br/>This design holds a Nema 17 Motor in place while two gears increase the torque by 3:1. The cord for the blinds attaches to a face plate attached to the larger gear.

            I have a set of over-door hooks which are too large for the doors in my new house, which means they catch on the door frame when closing the door.

  <h3 id="Upgrades">Upgrades</h3>
  <p>I've made several improvements to the stock A8, some printed and some purchased, most of these are to improve the quality of prints, the rest are to make using it easier or less noisesome.

    <ul>
      <li>Glass Bed</li>
      <li>X/Y Belt Tensioners</li>
      <li>Extruder Fan Mount</li>
      <li>Kettle/IEC PSU Socket</li>
      <li>Rigid Wood Base</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>360' Blower Fan</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Designed to give even airflow over the print head, this improves cooling and stops potential artifacts / dimensional inaccuracy due to contstant pressure on cooling filament.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Glass Bed</td>
        <td>IMAGE</td>
        <td>Improves the first-layer quality and makes setup much easier.<br/>
          Glass by itself gives much lower bed adhesion than painters tape, however a thin layer of PVA glue will create a strong bond with a very smooth surface,
          or for ABS a thin layer of 'ABS Juice' works great.
          Glass also makes removing parts much easier when using PVA as the bed is removable and can be put under a warm tap to dissolve the PVA.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>X/Y Belt Tensioner</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Tighter belts give less wiggle room for the part which results in cleaner, more accurate models.<br/>
          A Loose belt results in the print head moving past the intended stop point and makes the print head more succeptible to movement from wobble in the frame,
         translating to waves on the X/Y lines.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Extruder Fan Mount</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>This is purely to make it easier to change filaments.
          <br/>
          To change filamanets, the screws holding the fan, heatsink, extruder block & stepper motor in place need to be unscrewed, and the filament fed into the extruder.
          With this upgrade, I can just swing the fan/heatsink away from the extruder block and have easy access to the extruder.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Kettle/IEC Socket</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Adding a socket to this printer is another QOL upgrade. As stock, you wire directly onto the included PSU as per the instructions, which works fine but looks dangerous and does leave 12V terminals exposed.
          This socket covers up exposed wires, and allows for removal of the power cable for easy transporting. It also has a switch which means I no longer have to turn the printer off at a wall socket
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Wooden Base</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>This doesn't benefit print quality in a direct way. Having a fixed base allows me to move the printer around much more easily, and gives an extra layer to reduce vibrational noise.
          Normally if you move an A8, you have to at least re-level the print bed, but this base prevents that.
