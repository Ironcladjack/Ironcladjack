          <p> In this role, my main responsibility is to provide advanced specialist support for colleagues in the lower tiers of customer support.
              This support is primarily troubleshooting issues customers have faced with their purchases, whether hardware or software related.
              I am required to constantly use my own in-depth knowledge of the main operating systems and popular devices, as well as learning and
              researching new information and techniques rapidly, while also handling either one of my colleagues or a customer.
              In addition to this, I step up to fill spaces in all other facets of the business, providing cover wherever needed, including managerial positions,
              direct customer support and staff training.

        <h4 class="float-right">May - July 2016</h4>
      </div>
          <p> As an Outreach Presenter, I gave presentations to visiting classes from secondary schools in the Plymouth area.
              These presentations were based on the concept of energy and electricity, how different countries generate electricity, and how they cope with the various problems surrounding it.
              In addition to this, I prepared and oversaw several group activities, in one of which the children designed, built, and tested wind turbines made from office supplies.

        <p>As part of my Third Year at Plymouth University, I completed a dissertation on efficient energy generation in rural areas, which focused on a small village in Cameroon, West Africa, with a very weak and unreliable power grid. I researched the area, decided which method of energy generation was most suitable, and then tested several designs  to determine the best blade type, while minimising the necessary materials and cost of the solution.</p>
